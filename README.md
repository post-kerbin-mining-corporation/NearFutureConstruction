## Features

A number of parts designed to help build cooler spacecraft with girders and trusses:

* **Tiny Truss Sets:** New tiny trusses in planar, triangular and square form factors extending the venerable Cubic Octagonal Strut
* **Hexagonal Truss Set:** A 1.25m set of trusses with a hexagonal profile. Includes a set of integrated tank parts
* **Octagonal Truss Set:** A 2.5m set of trusses with an octagonal profile. Includes a set of integrated tank parts and docking ports
* **Square Truss Set:** A 3.7sm set of large square trusses
* **Circular Trusses:** A 5m set of huge circular trusses
* **Linear Docking Ports:** Fancy, planar-only docking connectors
* **Truss Adapters:** Various skeletal adapters that look cool on ships

## Dependencies

### Required
These components are required for the mod to function and are bundled as part of any download:
* [ModuleManager (3.1.3)](https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager)
* [B9PartSwitch (2.6.0)](https://github.com/blowfishpro/B9PartSwitch)

## Installation

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, please do so.

NOTE: Do NOT rename or move folders within the GameData folder - this mod uses absolute paths to assets and will break if this happens.

## External Mod Compatibility

This mod includes compatibility patches for the following mods:
* [KSP-AVC](https://github.com/CYBUTEK/KSPAddonVersionChecker): Provides version checking
* [Community Tech Tree](https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/CommunityTechTree): Provides an expanded, community-sourced technology tree for modders to use
* Community Resource Pack: If installed, variants for the hexagonal and octagonal trusses will appear sporting Lithium, LqdHydrogen, Argon and LqdHydrogen/Oxidizer

## Contributing

I certainly accept pull requests. Please target all such things to the `dev` branch though!
